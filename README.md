### Assignment
I have made this little exercise to show that I know the bascis of implementing a VR video in Unity. 
- This assignment contains two 360* videos that can be watched by the user (both of max 100MB).
- A main menu where the user can choose which video to watch.
- A play & pause button during the video.
- A stop button which sends you back to the main menu.
- The option to look around during video playback.

<br>The goal of this repository is to come up with my own ideas for this assignment <br>
and let my creativity flow while learning new skills.
