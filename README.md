### Assignment
I have made this little exercise to show that I know the bascis of implementing a VR video in Unity. 
- This assignment contains two 360* videos that can be watched by the user (both of max 100MB).
- A main menu where the user can choose which video to watch.
- A play & pause button during the video.
- A stop button which sends you back to the main menu.
- The option to look around during video playback.

<br>The goal of this repository is to come up with my own ideas for this assignment <br>
and let my creativity flow while learning new skills. 
<br>

### What did I learn?
By making this small project I learned how easy it is to get a (VR) video to work in Unity. 
I also learned that I DON'T need to add a video-management script of my own, 
since the "Video Player"-component already handles this itself. 
I thought making this assignment was going to take a lot of time, but it actually went very easy and fast!
Next up: learning how to add your own video and how to interact with it!
