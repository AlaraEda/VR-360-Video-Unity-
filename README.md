I can show you the world.

                  Splendid...!

### Assignment
I have made this little exercise to show that I know the bascis of implementing a VR video in Unity. 
- This assignment contains two 360* videos that can be watched by the user (both of max 100MB).
- A main menu where the user can choose which video to watch.
- A play & pause button during the video.
- A stop button which sends you back to the main menu.
- The option to look around during video playback.

<br>The goal of this repository is to come up with my own ideas for this assignment <br>
and let my creativity flow while learning new skills. 
<br>

### How I did it
I made this assignment in two ways. One way you can find in the master branch and the other you can find in the Android branch.
If you use the files of the Master branch you can look around the scene by using only your mouse. If you decide to build it for your Android, I would recommend to use the Android Branch. The Android Branch has an extra script that makes you ebale to look around the world using GyroControls. 

### What did I learn?
By making this small project I learned how easy it is to get a (VR) video to work in Unity. 
I also learned that I DON'T need to add a video-management script of my own, 
since the "Video Player"-component already handles this itself. 
I thought making this assignment was going to take a lot of time, but it actually went very easy and fast!
Next up: learning how to add your own video and how to interact with it!
